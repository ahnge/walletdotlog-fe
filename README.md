# Walletdotlog

An expense tracker app. Just a basic CRUD api that I did all on my own without following the tutorial for practicing my react skills.

## Features

- CRUD
- Authentication
- Email confirmation
- Social Login

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, ReactQuery, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI

**Server:** Django, DjangoRestFramework

## Lessons Learned

State management was a pain in the ass before I learned how to use [ReactQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/?from=reactQueryV3&original=https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/). I enjoyed deleting a lot of lines after refactoring my entire logic by using react-query for sever state management.
